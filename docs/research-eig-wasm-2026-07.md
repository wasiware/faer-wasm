# Eigvals (nonsymmetric EVD) wasm research — 2026-07-10

Architect direction: deep-research eigvals for speed and correctness on
wasm. faer's `eigenvalues()` measured **0.3–0.4× scipy** — the worst ratio
in the suite. Two tracks ran in parallel: the adversarially-verified
deep-research harness (results appended when it completes) and the
empirical track below (faer source reading + runner phase/parameter
probes, `bench/evd-tune.mjs`, run 29118452323). The empirical track found
the root cause before the harness returned.

## What faer's eigvals pipeline actually is (source-verified)

- `eigenvalues()` → `evd_real` with `ComputeEigenvectors::No`: Hessenberg
  reduction, then `real_schur::multishift_qr` with `want_t=false`,
  `Z=None` — the LAPACK `JOB='E'` equivalent. **No unrequested vector
  work** (hypothesis eliminated).
- faer HAS modern small-bulge multishift QR + aggressive early deflation
  (`multishift_qr`, `aggressive_early_deflation`, scalar `lahqr`
  fallback), structurally mirroring `dlaqr0`/`dlaqr2-5`, with
  `SchurParams { recommended_shift_count, recommended_deflation_window,
  blocking_threshold=75, nibble_threshold=50 }`.
- Quirks vs LAPACK found by source diff: the AED window is *always*
  solved by scalar `lahqr` (`real_schur.rs:837` — `if true ||` makes the
  recursive-multishift branch dead code; harmless at n≤512 where LAPACK
  would also use `dlahqr`); shift count / window are evaluated once on
  the full n (LAPACK's `iparmq` re-evaluates on the shrinking active
  block); the shift table caps at 32 for n<590 (LAPACK grows to
  ~n/log₂n ≈ 56 by n=512); `nibble=50` vs LAPACK's 14; Hessenberg blocks
  only from n≥256.

## THE ROOT CAUSE — a 1-line upstream bug, no_std only (patch 0004)

`faer/src/linalg/evd/schur/mod.rs:98`, the default AED deflation window
for 150 ≤ n < 590:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "std")]      { (n as f64 / (n as f64).log2()) as usize } // n/log2(n) ≈ 56 at n=512
#[cfg(not(feature = "std"))] { libm::log2(n as f64 / (n as f64)) as usize } // log2(n/n) = 0 !!
```

The `no_std` branch computes **log₂(n/n) = 0** instead of n/log₂(n). All
typical wasm builds are `no_std` (ours: `default-features=false`), so on
wasm the AED window silently degenerates to 2 (the `max(nwr,2)` clamp)
for every 150 ≤ n < 590: AED can deflate at most ~2 eigenvalues per call
and supplies at most 2 shifts, so every "multishift" sweep runs as a
degenerate 2-shift bulge chase with full blocked-sweep overhead.

**Measured on the runner (run 29118452323, eigenvalues-only, min-of-N):**

| n | variant | ms | AED calls / sweeps |
| - | - | -: | -: |
| 128 | faer default | 93.3 | 52 / 39 |
| 128 | lahqr-pinned | **14.6** | — |
| 128 | iparmq-style fns | 92.5 | 52 / 39 |
| 256 | faer default | 173.3 | **540 / 420** |
| 256 | lahqr-pinned | 109.8 | — |
| 256 | iparmq-style fns | 146.9 | **25 / 17** |
| 512 | faer default | 1459.4 | **1091 / 852** |
| 512 | lahqr-pinned | 929.6 | — |
| 512 | iparmq-style fns | **597.5** | **17 / 10** |

The iparmq-style replacement functions compute the *same intended table*
without the bug — the ~50–85× iteration collapse (852 → 10 sweeps at
n=512) is the bug's signature, not a tuning effect. n=128 is unaffected
(the window table's n<150 branch has no log₂), which also explains why
the two variants tie there. Dev-box verification with patch 0004 applied:
faer's *unmodified defaults* now converge in 25/17 (n=256) and 26/22
(n=512) — the defaults were never the problem; the arithmetic was.

**This bug also explains (for n≥150) the 2026-07-09 finding** that faer's
blocked multishift/AED path lost to its own scalar `lahqr` by 2–13× on
wasm (recorded in `schur/src/real.rs` `recommended_params`, which pins
faer-schur to `lahqr`). That pin should be re-evaluated after 0004: at
n=512 the repaired multishift path (597 ms) beats lahqr-pinned (930 ms)
by 1.56×; at n≤256 lahqr still wins (110 vs 147 ms at 256, 15 vs 93 ms at
128) — the wasm crossover sits between 256 and 512, far above the
`nmin=75` default. Still to tune: `blocking_threshold` on wasm.

## Phase split (same run)

| n | Hessenberg | full eigvals | Hessenberg share |
| - | -: | -: | -: |
| 64 | 0.27 ms | 3.11 ms | 9% |
| 128 | 3.32 ms | 91.6 ms | 4% |
| 256 | 46.2 ms | 170.8 ms | 27% |
| 512 | 215.3 ms | 1509.6 ms | 14% |

(Shares computed against the *buggy* totals; against the repaired 597 ms
at n=512, Hessenberg is ~36% — it becomes a first-class target once the
QR-iteration side is fixed. The blocked-Hessenberg panel is GEMV-rich and
our measured GEMV runs at ~30% of bandwidth: the flat-simd128 panel +
block-apply rebuild, task #17's deferred half, addresses exactly this.)

## Scoreboard context

Run 8 (three-way, 2026-07-10): faer eigvals 0.3–0.4× scipy. The repaired
n=512 time (597 ms vs buggy 1459 ms, 2.44×) projects eigvals to roughly
parity with scipy before any wasm-shaping work (Hessenberg kernel,
blocking_threshold tuning, shift-table shaping) — to be confirmed by a
full three-way re-run on the runner with 0004 applied.

## Runner confirmation of 0004 (run 29119237626)

With the patch applied, on the reference machine, eigenvalues-only:

| n | default (buggy → fixed) | counters (buggy → fixed) | lahqr-pinned |
| - | - | - | - |
| 128 | 94.3 ms (unchanged) | 52/39 (unchanged) | **14.7 ms** (6.4×) |
| 256 | 173.3 → **149.7 ms** | 540/420 → **25/17** | **110.2 ms** (1.36×) |
| 512 | 1459.4 → **598.1 ms** (2.44×) | 1091/852 → **26/22** | 960.6 ms (0.62×) |

Post-fix, faer's defaults match the iparmq-style profile exactly (597 vs
598 ms at n=512) — parameter re-shaping is NOT needed; only the bug was.
The multishift-vs-lahqr **sign flips at large n**: multishift now wins at
n=512 (1.61×), lahqr still wins at n≤256 (6.4× at 128, 1.36× at 256). So
the wasm-right `blocking_threshold` sits between 256 and 512 (default 75
is far too low for wasm; n=128 is untouched by the bug and still 6.4×
better on lahqr — that residual gap is real wasm shaping, not the bug).
faer-schur's `recommended_params` lahqr pin (usize::MAX) must be
re-swept for the Schur-with-vectors case post-0004.

## Three-way with 0004 (pyodide run 29119238887)

| op | n | faer | scipy | ratio (pre-0004) |
| - | -: | -: | -: | - |
| eigvals | 128 | 131.9 ms | 11.2 ms | 0.1× (unchanged — bug starts at 150) |
| eigvals | 256 | 204.1 ms | 85.3 ms | 0.4× (0.3×) |
| eigvals | 512 | 835.9 ms | 592.5 ms | **0.7×** (0.3–0.4×) |
| schur | 512 | 2083.5 ms | 744.8 ms | 0.4× (lahqr-pinned, pays at large n) |

(The eigvals@512 wall time differs between runner instances — 598 ms on
the evd-tune machine vs 836 ms here; ratios within a run are the honest
comparison.) What the full grid adds beyond the bug:

1. **faer's multishift is ~8× slower than LAPACK's multishift at n=128**
   (94 vs 11 ms) where the window bug never applied and iteration counts
   are modest (52 AED/39 sweeps) — a genuine per-sweep implementation gap
   on wasm (suspects: `multishift_qr_sweep`'s small-gemm block updates
   and workspace copies on 2 lanes). Meanwhile faer's scalar lahqr
   (14.7 ms) is within 1.3× of scipy — so at n≤256 the cheap move is the
   threshold, and the expensive question is the sweep kernel.
2. **A wasm-tuned `blocking_threshold` ≈ 384** (lahqr below, multishift
   above) projects eigvals to ~0.7–0.8× scipy across all sizes with no
   further code: 14.7 ms @128 (0.76×), 110 @256 (0.77×), 598 @512
   (0.99× on matched hardware). Companion-level params (faer's public
   `evd_real` takes `Spec<EvdParams>`) — no additional patch needed.
3. **faer-schur's lahqr pin now costs 2.8× at n=512** for Schur-with-Z
   (2083 vs ~750 ms) — re-sweep the pin post-0004.
