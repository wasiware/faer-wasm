# faer-wasm vs Pyodide (scipy/numpy on wasm) — 2026-07-09

The first external head-to-head, per the architect's benchmark direction:
the same problems solved by the incumbent scientific-computing-on-wasm
stack, in the same V8, both sides single-threaded and paying the same
wasm tax. Run on a GitHub Actions runner (`pyodide-bench.yml`,
`bench/pyodide-vs-faer.mjs`): faer bench-harness wasm (opt-level 3,
carried patches, `faer-schur` for Schur) vs Pyodide 314.0.2 with
numpy 2.4.3 / scipy 1.18.0 under node v22.23.1. Adaptive min-of-3 per
measurement; n = 64 / 128 / 256.

## Headline — honest version

**Pyodide wins most of this suite.** Geomean speedup of faer-wasm over
Pyodide: **0.41×** — i.e. scipy/numpy's LAPACK stack on wasm is ~2.4×
faster overall at these sizes. [Correction from Run 4: the stack is
OpenBLAS 0.3.28 with generic C kernels, not f2c'd reference LAPACK —
the "simple loops compile to lean wasm" reading below survives, the
library attribution does not.] faer-wasm wins exactly where its
hand-written gemm microkernels dominate (matmul, 4–5× at n ≥ 128, real
and complex); it loses the factorizations and eigensolvers, typically
2–10×.

## Reading it

- **The pattern is one story told twice.** faer's kernels are shaped for
  native machines: wide SIMD, deep blocking, cache-oblivious recursion.
  On wasm those shapes become overhead — this is the same disease as
  every blocking cliff this repo has measured, now visible externally.
  Their stack is simple loops that compile to lean wasm and, at
  n ≤ 256, win. [Run 4 identified it: OpenBLAS generic-C kernels, not
  f2c'd Fortran — same shape argument, corrected attribution.]
- **matmul is the counterexample that proves it**: the gemm crate's
  microkernels are the one place faer's approach carries to wasm, and
  there faer beats numpy's wasm matmul 4–5×. That gap is also the
  long-game lever — LAPACK's own blocked factorizations bottom out in
  dgemm, ours in the fast gemm, so the crossover should flip toward
  faer as n grows past this table. Unmeasured; next question.
- **The §7 tuned kernels close some gap but not all of it**: tuned LU at
  n=128 is ~0.24× of the default (≈ 0.77 ms) vs Pyodide's 0.56 ms; QR
  panel-1 ≈ 1.9 ms vs 1.31 ms. The comparison above uses faer's
  *default* high-level calls, which is what a naive consumer gets.
- **eigvals @128 (0.1×) is faer's `.eigenvalues()` blocking cliff**
  (`benchmarks-2026-07.md`) — no public params to fix it; `faer-schur`'s
  tuned Schur is the workaround and scores 0.6× rather than 0.1×.

## Caveats

- Each side does its idiomatic call for the same problem (e.g. QR is
  R-only on both sides via `mode='r'`; SVD computes full U/V on both).
- One run, one shared runner, min-of-3 — treat entries within ~±30% as
  ties; the 3×+ gaps are real.
- Pyodide numbers include no marshalling: timing loops run entirely in
  Python inside the wasm VM, as ours run entirely in wasm.
- n ≤ 256 only (leak-capped harness). The matmul advantage says the
  large-n story likely reverses; not yet evidence.

## Follow-ups recorded in ROADMAP

1. Extend to n = 512/1024 for the crossover (factorizations ride gemm).
2. Re-run with §7-tuned faer calls to quantify the honest best-case.
3. The strategic option nobody has taken: faer's algorithms with
   wasm-shaped parameters everywhere (what `faer-schur` did for Schur).

## Regenerate

Actions → "pyodide bench" → Run workflow (manual; the dev container
blocks the Pyodide CDN, runners don't). Results: job log + artifact.

## Run 2 — crossover sweep to n=512 + tuned rows (2026-07-09, run 28994239085)

Same protocol, sizes extended to 512, plus tuned-parameter faer rows
(docs/wasm.md §7 params; factor-only LU vs `scipy.linalg.lu_factor`,
R-only QR both sides). Highlights (full table in the workflow artifact):

| op | n=64 | n=128 | n=256 | n=512 |
| - | -: | -: | -: | -: |
| matmul | 0.7× | 4.1× | 6.1× | **21.0×** |
| matmul_c64 | 0.5× | 1.4× | 4.0× | 4.9× |
| **qr_r_tuned** | **1.3×** | **1.5×** | **1.7×** | **1.7×** |
| lu_factor_tuned | 1.3× | 0.8× | 0.7× | 0.6× |
| qr_r (default) | 0.1× | 0.1× | 0.2× | 0.4× |
| lu_factor (default) | 0.1× | 0.1× | 0.2× | 0.2× |
| svd | 0.2× | 0.4× | 0.5× | 0.8× |
| qr_r_c64 | 0.2× | 0.4× | 0.8× | 1.1× |
| eigvals | 0.5× | 0.1× | 0.4× | 0.3× |
| schur | 0.2× | 0.6× | 0.4× | 0.3× |
| schur_c64 | 0.4× | 1.0× | 0.7× | 0.7× |

(speedup = pyodide/faer; > 1 means faer-wasm wins. Geomean over all
rows incl. defaults: 0.52×.)

What this changes:

- **QR is already won — by parameters alone.** Panel-width-1 QR beats
  scipy at every size measured, 1.3–1.7×. The "QR panel kernel rewrite"
  collapses to a packaging problem: consumers must get these params by
  default (the faer-schur `recommended_params` treatment), not to a
  kernel-implementation problem.
- **LU's residual gap is now precisely bounded**: tuned LU wins at n=64
  and sits at 0.6–0.8× for 128–512 — the panel-kernel rewrite is chasing
  a 1.25–1.7× residual, not the 5–10× default-path gap.
- **Crossovers exist but are matmul-led**: matmul 21× at n=512 (numpy's
  wasm matmul collapses at cache-unfriendly sizes), complex QR crosses
  to 1.1×, SVD approaches parity (0.8×). Per the architect's caveat,
  large-n-only wins are scoping data, not victory — recorded as such.
- **Eigen-pipelines stay the weak flank at every size** (0.1–0.6×):
  unchanged conclusion — the lahqr-class kernel work is where their gap
  lives, queued after QR/LU per the architect's ordering.

## Run 3 — first wasm-shaped kernel enters the ring (2026-07-09, run 28995103525)

`lu_factor_wk` is `faer-wasm-kernels`' blocked LU: lean simd128 panel +
faer-gemm trailing updates (kernels/src/lu.rs). Same box, four LU
implementations against scipy's `lu_factor`:

| n | wk (shaped) | faer tuned | faer default | scipy | wk vs scipy |
| -: | -: | -: | -: | -: | -: |
| 64 | **0.06 ms** | 0.07 ms | 0.87 ms | 0.08 ms | **1.5×** |
| 128 | **0.35 ms** | 0.45 ms | 3.22 ms | 0.38 ms | **1.1×** |
| 256 | 3.27 ms | 3.26 ms | 14.48 ms | 2.43 ms | 0.7× |
| 512 | **27.69 ms** | 30.50 ms | 68.42 ms | 18.37 ms | 0.7× |

Approach-validation read (new-faer vs old-faer vs incumbent):

- The shaped kernel is the **fastest LU on wasm among all faer paths at
  every size** — 9–14× over faer's defaults at 64–128, 2.5–4.4× at
  256–512, and it beats the best tuning by 10–30% except a tie at 256.
- It **beats scipy at n=64 and n=128** — the first faer LU ever to do so
  at any size. The shaping approach is validated in the regime where
  parameters alone had plateaued at 0.8–1.3×.
- The n ≥ 256 residual is real on equal hardware: 1.35× at 256, 1.5× at
  512. Flop accounting places it in the O(n²·nb) parts (panel + trsm at
  ~3 GF vs the gemm bulk's ~4.7): closing it needs higher-intensity
  panel updates (rank-2+), not more parameter search. Bounded,
  understood, and diminishing — the eigen flank's 2.5–3× gaps are the
  bigger target.

## Run 4 — recursive LU + the BLAS reveal (2026-07-09, run 29023029694)

`lu_factor_rec` is the recursive (`dgetrf2`/Toledo-shape) LU from
`docs/research-lu-wasm-2026-07.md` plan item 1: the panel's memory-bound
rank-1 work recast as trsm + gemm at growing ranks, flat simd128 loops
only below the crossover. Same box, five LU implementations vs scipy:

| n | rec | wk (blocked) | faer tuned | faer default | scipy | rec vs scipy |
| -: | -: | -: | -: | -: | -: | -: |
| 64 | **0.06 ms** | 0.06 ms | 0.08 ms | 1.48 ms | 0.09 ms | **1.5×** |
| 128 | **0.35 ms** | 0.36 ms | 0.45 ms | 3.17 ms | 0.38 ms | **1.1×** |
| 256 | **2.78 ms** | 3.26 ms | 3.29 ms | 13.88 ms | 2.44 ms | 0.9× |
| 512 | **22.40 ms** | 27.39 ms | 29.45 ms | 83.49 ms | 18.45 ms | 0.8× |

- **The recursion delivered what the research projected** (~20–22 ms at
  n=512; measured 22.40): 15% over the blocked wk driver at 256, 18% at
  512, identical below 256 (both go flat-loop-only there). scipy's lead
  shrank from 1.35×/1.5× to 1.14×/1.21×.
- **But not the way the theory said**: narrow crossovers (8–32) *lose* —
  each skinny gemm's call overhead exceeds the flat-loop cost it
  replaces. The winning shape is coarse: crossover 128, trsm base 64.
  Measurement beat theory on the constants; the structure survived.
- **The incumbent is now identified, not guessed** (this run prints
  `numpy/scipy.show_config()`): Pyodide's scipy links **OpenBLAS 0.3.28
  built with the generic C `RISCV64_GENERIC` target** (config string:
  `... NO_AFFINITY=1 USE_OPENMP= RISCV64_GENERIC MAX_THREADS=4`), via
  Emscripten. No architecture microkernels. Run 1's "f2c'd reference
  LAPACK" read was wrong about the library and right about the shape:
  their hot loops are autovectorized generic C, which explains both why
  simple faer paths lost to it and why our gemm beats it 4–20×.
- Suite geomean: **0.57×** (Run 1: 0.41×) — the LU/QR wins and the
  matmul crossover pull it up; the eigen flank (0.1–0.6×) is what holds
  it down and is the queued target.
