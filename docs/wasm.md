# faer on wasm32 — the consumer recipe

How to depend on faer from a `wasm32-unknown-unknown` crate. Everything
here is measured, not assumed; the evidence trail is
`research-faer-wasm-2026-07.md` and the enforcement is
`.github/workflows/wasm-gate.yml`. Toolchain of record: rustc 1.94.1,
node 22.

## 0. You need the carried patches

Plain faer 0.24.4 from crates.io does **not** compile for any 32-bit
target — `(n >> 32)` on a 32-bit `usize` is a compile error in
`operator/{eigen,self_adjoint_eigen,svd}`; that's patch 0001 (4 lines).
Patch 0002 (6 lines, visibility-only) exposes the Schur kernels that §8's
companion crate drives. Patch 0003 (4 lines, to **pulp**) fixes the
relaxed-SIMD complex-multiply argument-order bug described in §4 — without
it, all c64 compute is wrong under `+relaxed-simd`. Set up the pinned +
patched checkout first (repo README "Quick start"): clone `faer-rs` and
`pulp`, pin to `patches/UPSTREAM-BASE.txt`, apply `patches/faer-rs/*` to
faer-rs and `patches/pulp/*` to pulp, then depend by path.

## 1. Cargo setup

```toml
[dependencies]
faer = { path = "../faer-rs/faer", default-features = false, features = ["linalg"] }
# optional but recommended — unlocks real FMA, see §4:
pulp = { path = "../pulp/pulp", default-features = false, features = ["relaxed-simd"] }

[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"     # size; "3" trades ~size for speed if you prefer
lto = true
codegen-units = 1
panic = "abort"
strip = true
```

Feature facts (all verified):

- `linalg` alone builds and gives the full dense suite: matmul, LU
  (partial + full pivot), Cholesky family, QR ± column pivoting, SVD,
  self-adjoint and general EVD, generalized EVD, triangular solve/inverse,
  full complex support.
- `linalg,std` also builds on wasm32.
- `rayon` does **not** build (`atomic-wait` has no wasm port) and must
  stay off. `Par::Seq` is a first-class argument accepted by every compute
  routine — sequential is the wasm mode, not a degraded fallback.

## 2. no_std / zero-import modules

For a module that instantiates with an empty import object (no JS glue,
no wasm-bindgen), see `smoke-test/src/lib.rs`: `crate-type = ["cdylib"]`,
`#![no_std]`, a **LIFO-rewind** bump allocator over `memory.grow` seeded
from `__heap_base`, and a `panic_handler` that hits `unreachable`. The
produced module needs zero imports:

**⚠ Do not use a leak-only bump allocator** (the pattern this repo
recommended before 2026-07-11). faer's **c64 matmul allocates per-call
temporaries through the global allocator** (its f64 path doesn't): one
c64 multishift-Schur call at n=600 was measured at **15.4 GB cumulative
across ~25K allocations** — peak *live* memory only ~19 MB, so any
freeing allocator is fine, but a leak-only bump hits the 4 GB wasm32
ceiling inside a single call and the next allocation returns null →
`memory access out of bounds`. The fix is three lines in `dealloc`
(rewind the bump pointer when the freed block is the most recent
allocation — faer's temporaries are nested, so nearly all of the traffic
reclaims); the guard that this stays sufficient is
`kernels/tests/alloc_probe.rs`.

```js
const { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiate(bytes, {});
```

## 3. Sizes (pre-wasm-opt, pre-gzip)

Measured 2026-07-08 on the smoke test (pulp `relaxed-simd` feature in the
tree; budgets enforced in CI via `smoke-test/size-budgets.json`):

| variant | bytes | budget |
| - | -: | -: |
| matmul only | 59,207 | 66,000 |
| + LU solve | 123,751 | 137,000 |
| + QR, SVD, both EVDs, Schur, dense c64 suite | 921,812 | 1,014,000 |
| same, `+simd128,+relaxed-simd` baked in | 905,452 | 996,000 |

The full variant is dominated by c64 monomorphizations added as the
foundation gate grew: from ~447 KB, real Schur + reordering added ~26 KB
(kernels already present via the EVD), the c64 Schur/eigensolver stack
~260 KB, and the c64 LU/QR/LLT/SVD/hermitian-EVD stacks another ~183 KB.
A real-only consumer stays near ~500 KB; ~400 KB remains the lean
planning number (research staging). `wasm-opt` and gzip/brotli transport
shrink all of these further (unmeasured here).

## 4. SIMD

pulp (faer's SIMD layer) ships a complete wasm backend; nothing needs to
be contributed or configured upstream.

- **Baseline:** simd128 code paths are compiled behind
  `#[target_feature]` and selected at runtime via a host-set flag
  (`pulp-wasm-simd-flag`), or selected at compile time by building with
  `-C target-feature=+simd128`.
- **FMA (the big lever):** depend on `pulp` with
  `features = ["relaxed-simd"]` (cargo feature unification does the rest)
  and build with:

  ```sh
  RUSTFLAGS='-C target-feature=+simd128,+relaxed-simd' cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
  ```

  This emits real `f64x2.relaxed_madd` (253 occurrences in the research
  disassembly vs 0 baseline) and runs in node 22 and any
  relaxed-SIMD-capable browser. The gate builds this variant on every
  push and its results are bit-identical to the plain build for the
  reference probes.

- **⚠ Upstream pulp bug, fixed by carried patch 0003.** As shipped at
  our pin, `+relaxed-simd` makes pulp's **complex kernels produce grossly
  wrong results** — found 2026-07-08 by the Schur gate (c64 Hessenberg
  backward error ‖·‖² ≈ 186; even faer's public `.eigenvalues()` on
  complex input returned garbage), then isolated stage by stage: c64
  matmul exact, Hessenberg wrong → pulp's wasm `RelaxedSimd` impl of
  `mul_add_e_c32s/c64s` and `mul_e_c32s/c64s` passes NEON
  **accumulator-first** FMA arguments (`vfmaq(c,a,b) = c + a·b`, the
  convention of the aarch64 backend this code was ported from) to the
  **accumulator-last** `relaxed_madd(a,b,c) = a·b + c`, computing
  `(c·b_sign + yx)·aa + xy` instead of `c + b_sign·yx + aa·xy`. The
  4-line fix is carried as `patches/pulp/0003`; with it applied, both
  Schur probes pass identically on plain and relaxed builds, and CI
  requires that on every push. If a future pulp release fixes this
  upstream, drop the patch.

## 5. Determinism — scope it carefully

The three original smoke-test probe values are **bit-identical** between
native x86-64 and wasm (all variants, including relaxed-SIMD):

```
matmul_trace     = 114
lu_solve_sum     = 0.8857142857142857   (31/35)
qr_svd_evd_probe = 1.9483450492039642
```

CI compares exactly (`Object.is`, no tolerance). For *those probes*,
treat any cross-target difference as a bug, not noise.

**Bit-identity does not generalize.** The first counterexample (found
2026-07-08): the raw doubles out of an 8×8 Schur decomposition differ
between native and wasm in the last ulps — pulp's reduction order
depends on SIMD width (AVX vs simd128), which the tiny 3×3 probes never
exposed — and under relaxed-SIMD FMA the QR iteration can take a
different path entirely, landing the (canonically unordered) eigenvalues
in a different diagonal order. All results are equally *correct* (same
backward error); they are not the same bits. The gate therefore scores
the Schur pipeline by integer-valued correctness properties
(`schur_probe` = 11, `schur_probe_cplx` = 3) and bit-compares the score.
Takeaway for consumers: expect bit-reproducibility per fixed
target+flags, not across targets, once matrices are big enough for SIMD
reductions to kick in.

## 6. What CI enforces (`wasm gate`)

On every push/PR: fetch both upstreams at the pinned commits → apply
`patches/` → run the `faer-schur` accuracy tests natively → build all
four variants → run each under node with exact value checks and size
budgets → cross-target determinism (bit-for-bit) → the same probes in
**headless Chrome** (`browser-check.mjs`, raw CDP — a real browser, not
node) → the **efficiency gate** (`bench/gate.mjs`: op/matmul ratio bands,
O(n³) scaling windows, tuned-vs-default guards). If a faer re-pin or a
dependency bump breaks the build, changes a result bit, bloats a binary
past budget, or introduces a cliff-class slowdown, the gate fails. `schur_probe_cplx == 3` is required
on both full variants — on full-relaxed it doubles as the regression
guard for the carried pulp fix (§4): a re-pin that drops the patch while
upstream is still broken fails immediately.

## 7. Blocking parameters on wasm (measured 2026-07-08)

faer's default blocking thresholds are tuned for native caches and
misfire badly on wasm — mid-size factorizations run up to ~10× slower
than necessary. (Caveat 2026-07-11: the specific ratios below were
measured before the LIFO-rewind allocator fix and are pessimistic about
faer's defaults; the *direction* of the guidance re-verifies on every
push via `bench/gate.mjs`, but re-measure before quoting the numbers.)
Measured fix (details + tables in
`benchmarks-2026-07.md`): **prefer unblocked kernels through n≈256** by
calling the low-level factor APIs with explicit parameters. The
high-level solvers (`.partial_piv_lu()`, `.qr()`) use the untuned
defaults, so hot paths should call:

```rust
use faer::linalg::lu::partial_pivoting::factor as lu;
use faer::linalg::qr::no_pivoting::factor as qr;
use faer::{Auto, Spec};

// LU: stay on the unblocked kernel (1.25–1.5× native, vs 2.3–9.6× default)
let params = lu::PartialPivLuParams {
    recursion_threshold: n, // measured win up to n = 256
    ..Auto::<f64>::auto()
};
lu::lu_in_place(a, &mut perm, &mut perm_inv, par, stack, Spec::new(params));

// QR, n ≥ 64: classical Householder, panel width 1 (≈ native speed,
// vs ~8–10× slower with the default panel width)
let mut q_coeff = Mat::<f64>::zeros(1, n); // block size = row count = 1
qr::qr_in_place(a, q_coeff.as_mut(), par, stack, Spec::new(Auto::<f64>::auto()));
```

Unmeasured beyond n=256 — blocked paths must win eventually; re-run
`bench/tune.mjs` before extrapolating. SVD/self-adjoint EVD carry related
(smaller) overheads via their internal bidiag/tridiag stages; untuned for
now.

**Schur / general eigenvalues: two distinct fixes** (revised 2026-07-11).
The 2026-07-09 measurement of "blocked multishift/AED loses 2–13× to
`lahqr` through n=384" turned out to be an upstream bug for n ≥ 150, not
a tuning fact: faer's `no_std` AED-deflation-window default computed
`log2(n/n)` = 0, collapsing the window to 2 and exploding iteration
counts ~50–85× — fixed by carried `patches/faer-rs/0004` (see
`research-eig-wasm-2026-07.md`). Post-fix, the real wasm crossover is
n≈480: scalar `lahqr` wins below, multishift wins from n=512.
`faer-schur`'s `recommended_params(n)` routes per size (the routing must
live *outside* `SchurParams` — `blocking_threshold` doubles as `nmin`
inside the solver). faer's own `.eigenvalues()` takes no params; on wasm
prefer `faer-schur::real::real_eigenvalues` (eigenvalues-only pipeline)
or, fastest measured, the `faer-wasm-kernels` Hessenberg + `hqr`
pipeline (replication-gated wins over scipy at n=64–256 and 1024,
parity at 512). Tables in `research-eig-wasm-2026-07.md`; the parameters
are provisional pending the global tuning pass (ROADMAP tuning freeze).

## 8. Schur decomposition + eigenvalue reordering (`faer-schur`)

faer computes the Schur form internally (its EVD pipeline) but does not
expose it. The companion crate `schur/` in this repo provides it over
faer's public modules — `gees`/`trexc`/`trsen`-shaped, `no_std`, builds
for wasm32 (it's in the `full` smoke variant, gated in CI):

```rust
use faer_schur::real::{real_schur, real_schur_select, real_schur_move};
use faer_schur::complex::complex_schur;

let s = real_schur(a.as_ref(), Par::Seq)?;      // A = Z T Zᵀ (T quasi-triangular)
// reorder: eigenvalues with Re λ > 0 into the leading m×m block
let select: Vec<bool> = (0..n).map(|k| s.w_re[k] > 0.0).collect();
let (mut t, mut z) = (s.t, s.z);
let m = real_schur_select(t.as_mut(), Some(z.as_mut()), &select)?;
```

In-place, allocation-free variants (`real_schur_in_place` +
`real_schur_scratch`, ditto complex) take a `MemStack`. Requires
`patches/faer-rs/0002-expose-schur-kernels.patch` on the pinned faer checkout —
a 6-line visibility-only patch (no behavior change), dropped the moment
upstream exposes the kernels. Accuracy is tested in CI
(`schur/tests/accuracy.rs`): backward error ‖A − ZTZᵀ‖ ~1e-15,
orthogonality, quasi-triangular structure, eigenvalue agreement with
faer's EVD, and reorder invariants, at sizes through n=150 (covering
both the unblocked and the blocked/AED paths). Its gate found (and
patch 0003 fixed) the c64×relaxed-SIMD bug in §4.
