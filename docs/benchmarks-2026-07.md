# faer wasm-vs-native benchmarks — 2026-07

First measured answer to "how fast is faer on wasm, and which build knobs
matter". Produced by `bench/` (see §Method); regenerate any time — these
numbers are a snapshot, not a guarantee.

- Toolchain: rustc 1.94.1, node v22.22.2 (V8), pinned faer 0539947 +
  `patches/`, pulp 5eb07fd.
- Host: shared cloud container (x86-64, AVX2+FMA native baseline). Shared
  = noisy; every cell is **min of 2 full repetitions**, and ratios (wasm ÷
  native on the same box) are the transferable result, not absolute times.
- Variants: `z` = `opt-level="z"` (the size-first profile from
  `docs/wasm.md`), `o3` = `opt-level=3`; `relaxed` = built with
  `-C target-feature=+simd128,+relaxed-simd` (FMA). Native baseline is
  `opt-level=3` with default host features.

## Findings

1. **`opt-level` is the biggest knob we control: ~1.75× overall.**
   Geomean slowdown 9.8× (`z`) → 5.6× (`o3`). The size-first profile is
   the right browser-payload default, but compute-heavy consumers should
   ship `opt-level=3` (+~7% size: 446→477 KB for the bench module).
2. **Relaxed-SIMD (FMA) adds ~11% overall, up to ~25% where it counts.**
   Biggest on SVD and self-adjoint EVD at n≥128 (e.g. SVD 256:
   134.5→110.7 ms). Costs +4% size at `o3`. Worth it.
3. **The good news: large matmul runs at 1.8–1.9× native.** The
   "wasm is near native" story is real for gemm at n≥128.
4. **The finding: mid-size factorizations fall off a cliff.** Native
   scales smoothly with n; wasm does not. LU jumps from 2.8× (n=32) to
   ~20× (n=64); QR from 2.4× to ~15×; general EVD from 2.1× (n=64) to
   ~13× (n=128). The reproducible oddity that LU at n=128 (`o3-relaxed`)
   costs the same 1.14 ms as n=64 points at blocking/threshold selection,
   not raw compute: faer/gemm's cache-size heuristics and kernel
   thresholds are tuned for native targets and misfire on wasm. This is
   exactly ROADMAP Phase 3's "blocking-parameter tuning — measure, don't
   assume" item, which now has its data. Small-n matmul (~25× at n=32)
   likely shares the cause (per-call dispatch/planning overhead).
5. **Honest summary number: geomean ~5× for the best variant** over this
   grid (n=32…256, six ops) — worse than the 1.3–2× folklore, and the gap
   is concentrated in the mistuned mid-size cells rather than spread
   evenly. Fixing item 4 is the path to pulling the geomean toward the
   large-matmul ratio.

## Method

Same ops, sizes, and adaptive-iteration logic on both targets
(`bench/src/lib.rs` shared; `bench/bench.mjs` times wasm from node,
`bench/src/bin/native.rs` times native): per cell, warmup call, then
enough iterations for ~150 ms (min 3, capped at 500 and by projected
allocator leak — the wasm module uses the same leak-only bump allocator
as smoke-test and is re-instantiated per op). Each `run_*` returns a
probe double to defeat dead-code elimination.

Regenerate:

```sh
cd bench
cargo run --release --bin native native-o3 > native-o3.jsonl
for p in "release-z z" "release o3"; do set -- $p
  cargo build --lib --profile $1 --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
  cp target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/$1/bench_harness.wasm $2-plain.wasm
  RUSTFLAGS='-C target-feature=+simd128,+relaxed-simd' \
    cargo build --lib --profile $1 --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
  cp target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/$1/bench_harness.wasm $2-relaxed.wasm
done
for v in z-plain z-relaxed o3-plain o3-relaxed; do
  node bench.mjs $v.wasm wasm-$v > wasm-$v.jsonl
done
node report.mjs native-o3.jsonl wasm-*.jsonl
```
