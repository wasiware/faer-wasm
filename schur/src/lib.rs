//! Schur decomposition and eigenvalue reordering as a companion crate to the
//! carried faer — the first Phase 2 item (LAPACK-parity tail).
//!
//! - [`real`]: `A = Z T Zᵀ` for `f64`, `T` quasi upper triangular (`dgees` /
//!   `dtrexc` / `dtrsen`-shaped).
//! - [`complex`]: `A = Z T Zᴴ` for `c64`, `T` upper triangular (`zgees` /
//!   `ztrexc` / `ztrsen`-shaped).
//!
//! Everything is built over faer's public modules (`hessenberg`,
//! `evd::schur::{real_schur, complex_schur}`); the latter two are public only
//! with `patches/faer-rs/0002-expose-schur-kernels.patch` applied (visibility-only,
//! no behavior change). No faer code is duplicated here — this crate is the
//! driver (Hessenberg → Z accumulation → multishift QR) plus the
//! LAPACK-flavored reordering loops.
//!
//! `no_std`: needs only a global allocator (see `smoke-test/src/lib.rs` for
//! the zero-import wasm pattern).
