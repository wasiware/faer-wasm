# tests/ — correctness suites and the bit-identical results

One test file per BLAS routine, mirroring `../src/` (naming:
`../src/README.md`); `main.rs` per level folder is the Cargo test
target, `common.rs` holds the shared generator and the
higher-precision reference summers. Run with
`cd blas && cargo test --release` — **144 tests, all green**.
Benchmarks live in `../bench/README.md`; this page is the
correctness half of the contract.

## What each routine is tested to

The standard is the strongest the routine's math allows (the full
contract rationale is in the crate README). All four types are tested
identically; the f32 and c32 bounds use f64-accumulated references
(products formed in the working precision, as the implementation
forms them).

| routine(s) | standard |
|---|---|
| copy, swap, scal, axpy, rot | **bit-for-bit** vs the scalar definition |
| dot, asum | error-bounded vs compensated/f64 reference |
| nrm2 | error-bounded + over/underflow guard cases at each type's range (1e±300 / 1e±30) |
| iamax | **exact index**, incl. BLAS first-occurrence tie-breaking |
| rotg | defining identities + reference edge cases + subnormal smoke |
| gemv, ger, syr, syr2, trmv, trsv | **bit-for-bit same-order scalar replay** + independent bounds (trsv also residual-verified) |
| symv | error-bounded (the fused pass legitimately re-folds its reduction) |
| gemm, syrk, syr2k | **bit-for-bit replay** + bounds; gemm's four shapes (colaxpy / tile / col4 / packed) cross-checked bit-identical — the packed replay crosses the KC/MC/MR block boundaries and a dispatch-zone replay routes above the packed threshold — so the size dispatch is invisible |
| symm | left: bounds (rides symv); right: **bit-for-bit replay** |
| trmm, trsm | **bit-for-bit replay** both sides + bounds/residuals — the two elimination-order reorders (trmm_right-upper, trsm_right-lower) are documented in their files and the replays mirror them; the other triangles replay the PLAIN order, proving the blocked shapes bit-identical to it |
| zaxpy, zscal, zdscal, zcopy, zswap, zdrot | **bit-for-bit** vs the scalar `C64` definition (the SIMD product form is a bit-exact rewrite of it) |
| zdotu, zdotc | error-bounded vs a component-wise compensated reference; plus `zdotc(x,y) == zdotu(conj x, y)` **bitwise** (the conjugation folds into lane signs exactly) |
| dznrm2, dzasum | error-bounded (delegations to the d-streams; nrm2 guard cases at 1e±300) |
| izamax | **exact index** on \|re\|+\|im\|, incl. first-occurrence ties |
| zrotg | defining identities (c²+\|s\|²=1, c·a+s·b=r, −conj(s)a+cb=0) + a=0 reference case + 1e±150/±300 extremes |
| zgemv, zgeru, zgerc, ztrmv, ztrsv | **bit-for-bit same-order replay** (+ bounds; ztrsv residual-verified; `zgerc == zgeru(conj y)` and `zgemv_c == zgemv_t(conj A)` bitwise) |
| zhemv | error-bounded (fused pass re-folds its reduction); stored diagonal imag poisoned to prove it is ignored |
| zher, zher2 | **bit-for-bit replay** + diagonal ends exactly real (+0.0 imag, the Hermitian invariant) |
| zgemm | **bit-for-bit replay** + bounds; col4 AND packed (the complex register tile) vs colaxpy cross-checked bit-identical, plus the dispatch-zone replay |
| zhemm | left: bounds (rides zhemv); right: **bit-for-bit replay** through the conjugating triangle lookup |
| zherk, zher2k | **bit-for-bit replay** incl. the real-β component scale and the exactly-real diagonals |
| ztrmm, ztrsm | **bit-for-bit replay** both sides — same reorder disclosures as the real twins, replays mirror them; residuals for ztrsm |
| the c-routines (c32) | the z-suite cloned one-for-one at the two-complexes-per-register lane geometry: same replays bit-for-bit, bounds vs f64-accumulated references, crotg identities in f32 at 1e±15/±30 extremes, the same conjugation cross-checks and Hermitian-diagonal invariants |

## Cross-target bit-identity — the results

The standing guarantee: our code produces **identical bits on native
x86-64 and wasm**, by construction (`../src/lanes.rs` emulates the
SIMD lane structure elementwise off-wasm, and every reduction folds
its lanes in a fixed order). It is verified by 90 determinism probes
(21 f64 + 21 f32 + 24 c64 + 24 c32) — fixed-LCG inputs at odd sizes
so every tail path runs, folded to one f64 — checked on every
roofline run and on every reference-runner draw to date, **all green
on every check**.

The expected patterns (a probe value changes ONLY when an
accumulation order is changed deliberately, like the symv fold — any
other change is a bug, not noise):

Regenerate/verify: `cd ../bench && cargo run --release --bin native
l{1,2,3}-bits[-f32|-z|-c]` for the native side; the roofline scripts
compare the wasm build against a bits file and abort on any mismatch.
These values have been continuous through the tuning campaign's
bit-preserving levers and the 2026-07-19 restructures (verified at
each move).

Known limits of the probes, recorded honestly: the L2/L3 probe folds
are dominated by their solve-safe diagonals (~5e4), so they are weak
detectors of reduction-order changes below one ULP of the total
(docs step 8) — the per-routine replay tests above are the strong
order locks; the probes' job is cross-target identity, which they
gate hard.
