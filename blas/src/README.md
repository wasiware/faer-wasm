# src/ — the call graph

Which operations call which operations. **One node = one
mathematically distinct operation** — 27 of them: the 23 netlib-named
routines (= the files per type) with the flag variants split out,
because a transposed product or a side swap is a different result
(gemv_t; symm/trmm/trsm left and right). gemm's internal loop shapes
are NOT extra nodes — they produce bit-identical results. This graph
covers the f64 and f32 layers, which have identical structure; the
c64 layer's differences are listed below it.

Notes:

- Below the operations sits shared plumbing, deliberately not in the
  graph: the private SIMD kernels (`kernels.rs` — blocked hot loops
  several operations share), the lane types (`lanes.rs`), gemm's
  internal shapes and dispatcher (inside the gemm files), and the
  small helpers (`check_mat`, `{d,s}scale_y`, `{d,s}sym_at`).
- `symv` has no outgoing arrows: its fused kernel replaced the
  axpy+dot composition it used to be.
- `rotg` and copy/swap/rot/nrm2/asum/iamax are leaves — nothing in
  the crate calls them; consumers do.

## The c64 layer (z-routines) — same graph, renamed nodes

The complex layer is the same picture with node substitutions —
**26 routines / 31 operations** (counting convention: crate README):

- *Splits*: `dot` → `dotu` + `dotc` (unconjugated/conjugated are
  different results); `ger` → `geru` + `gerc`; `gemv` gains a third
  form `gemv_c` (y ← αAᴴx, one `dotc` per column) beside `gemv` and
  `gemv_t`; `scal` gains the real-α `dscal` form.
- *Renames*: the symmetric family becomes Hermitian — `symv` → `hemv`
  (fused, no outgoing arrows, same as symv), `syr`/`syr2` →
  `her`/`her2`, `symm` → `hemm`, `syrk` → `herk`, `syr2k` → `her2k` —
  with the same edges as their real twins.
- *Delegations, not nodes*: `zcopy`/`zswap`/`zdrot`/`zdscal`/
  `dznrm2`/`dzasum` are one-line calls to the tuned d-routines on the
  interleaved 2n-real view (`c64.rs`) — they inherit the d-stream's
  speed, guards, and determinism rather than duplicating the loops.
- `rot` is the real-c,s `zdrot`; `zrotg` generates the complex Givens
  (c real, s complex) — the complex-s application (`zrot`) has no
  consumer yet.
