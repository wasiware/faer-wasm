# Instructions for Claude

This repo makes **faer** (pure-Rust linear algebra) usable as a first-class
`wasm32` dependency. It exists to serve a consumer (Ruju, a Rust
reimplementation of Julia for WebAssembly), but everything here is scoped
**language-agnostically** — work only on things any wasm-targeting consumer
of faer would want.

**Prime directive — thin carry.** Andy decided (2026-07-08) NOT to submit
anything upstream — do not prepare upstream PRs, issues, or contribution
material, and do not ask him to file anything. Instead we *carry* the
minimum: vendor the smallest possible patch set in `patches/`, keep it
`git am`-clean against the pinned base, and re-verify on every faer
release. If upstream ever fixes 32-bit builds independently, drop the
patch. New capability (Schur, Sylvester, …) is built **alongside** faer —
in companion crates or the consumer's shim over faer's public API — never
as patches to faer itself unless there is no other way.

Start by reading `README.md`, then `ROADMAP.md` (the phased plan — the
architect picks which phase to work; see the contract below), then
`docs/research-faer-wasm-2026-07.md` (the
empirical evidence behind the plan: measured sizes, pulp simd128 status,
the LinearAlgebra coverage matrix).

## Working contract (adopted 2026-07-08; modeled on Lua2D's AGENTS.md)

**Roles.** Andy is the **architect**: he decides *what* and *why* — scope,
priorities, trade-offs (e.g. nothing goes upstream; releases adopted on
our terms). A session is the **engineer**: it proposes *how*, executes
after agreement, and must not cut the architect out of decisions.

**Every pass, three steps.** (1) Report current state honestly,
uncertainties and failures included — the ROADMAP and the status artifact
are the medium. (2) The architect picks the next milestone; the engineer
may propose. (3) Agree the plan, then execute.

**Deviation routing.** Discoveries mid-milestone: unrelated → record in
ROADMAP and move on; blocking the milestone (or a small measurable win on
its path) → handle now; architectural → stop and ask the architect.

**Claim grading.** Every claim in README/docs carries evidence graded on
two independent axes: **strength** (stated < built < observed < tested <
proven) and **durability** (by-hand < scripted < CI-enforced <
cross-checked). Never grade a claim above its evidence, on either axis.
The evidence grid in `README.md` is the ledger — update it whenever a
claim is added or its evidence changes tier.

**Phase close.** Every phase ends with a truth-seeking **doc pass** —
docs checked against evidence, the opposite orientation from goal-seeking
code review. (The 2026-07-08 sweep is the model: it caught a tautological
test and six stale claims.)

## Working setup

- The upstream clones live at `faer-rs/` and `pulp/` in the repo root
  (gitignored — never commit them). Pin them to the commits in
  `patches/UPSTREAM-BASE.txt`; apply `patches/faer-rs/*.patch` to
  `faer-rs/` (0001: the 4-line 32-bit fix; 0002: 6 visibility-only lines
  exposing the Schur kernels) and `patches/pulp/*.patch` to `pulp/`
  (0003: 4-line fix for the relaxed-simd complex-mul argument-order bug
  — this one is a *correctness* fix, not behavior-neutral). All dropped
  when upstream makes them unnecessary.
- `schur/` is the first Phase 2 companion crate (`faer-schur`: Schur +
  eigenvalue reordering over faer's public API). Its gate:
  `cd schur && cargo test --release` (CI runs it too).
- Install the target if missing: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

## Verification (the gate for any change)

```sh
cd smoke-test
cargo build --lib --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release --features full
node check.mjs   # exact values (matmul / LU / QR / SVD / EVD) + size budget
```

(`--lib` matters: the `native` bin is host-only — building it for wasm is
a duplicate-`panic_impl` error. Determinism cross-check:
`cargo run --release --features full --bin native > native-bits.txt &&
node determinism.mjs <wasm> native-bits.txt`.)

Results were bit-identical between native x86-64 and wasm in the 2026-07
verification — treat any cross-target difference as a bug, not noise. CI
(`.github/workflows/wasm-gate.yml`) runs the same gate across all four
build variants with size budgets from `smoke-test/size-budgets.json`;
current sizes are tabulated in `docs/wasm.md` §3.

## Upstream policy

**Shelved by decision, not oversight.** A complete Phase 0 contribution
(fix + regression tests + wasm CI job) was prepared and archived under
`upstream/`; Andy chose not to submit it. Leave it archived, don't extend
it, and don't revisit the decision unless he raises it.

**Release policy (Andy, 2026-07-08): upstream is a resource, not an
obligation.** Evaluate each faer release; adopt it (re-pin, re-apply
`patches/`, re-run the gate) only when it advances our cause. Slight
accommodations to upstream changes are fine. If upstream's direction
deviates from our needs, do NOT follow it — stay on the pinned base; the
pin means nothing upstream can break us without our consent. If an
adopted release builds on 32-bit without our patch, delete the patch and
note it in ROADMAP.md.
