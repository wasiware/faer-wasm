# STATUS — the one-page scoreboard

Plain-English answer to three questions: **what did we change in faer,
what do we ship, and how good is it?** Updated at the end of every
working session. Details and evidence live in `docs/` and the README
evidence grid; this page is the summary you can hold in your head.

Last updated: 2026-07-18.

## 1. What we changed in faer itself

**Four patches, ~19 lines total.** That's everything. They live in
`patches/` and get applied to a pinned copy of faer on every build.

| patch | size | what it does |
| - | - | - |
| 0001 | 4 lines | fixes the compile error that stopped faer building on wasm at all |
| 0002 | 6 lines | makes faer's internal Schur functions public so our code can call them |
| 0003 | 4 lines (to pulp, faer's SIMD library) | fixes a bug that made all complex math wrong in one build mode |
| 0004 | 1 line | fixes a typo'd formula that made eigenvalue solving ~50–85× slower |

Everything else in this repo is **our own code in our own folders**
(`kernels/`, `schur/`, `smoke-test/`, `bench/`). It calls faer; it does
not modify faer.

## 2. What we ship, and how good it is

"vs scipy" = the honest head-to-head on the CI runner, both sides
running in the browser engine. Numbers >1 mean we're faster.

### Double precision, real numbers (f64) — the main product

| operation | works? | tested? | benchmarked? | vs scipy |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| multiply (matmul) | ✓ (faer's, unmodified) | ✓ | ✓ | 3–20× faster |
| solve Ax=b (LU) | ✓ our kernel | ✓ | ✓ | 1.6–2× faster |
| QR | ✓ our kernel | ✓ | ✓ | ~3× faster |
| SVD | ✓ (faer's, unmodified) | ✓ | ✓ | 0.7–1.5× (near its ceiling — proven) |
| eigenvalues | ✓ our kernel | ✓ | ✓ | 1.5–2.1× faster, all sizes |
| Schur (T and Z) | ✓ our kernel | ✓ | ✓ | 1.1–1.7× faster up to n=512; ~tie at 1024 |
| eigenvectors (full eig) | ✓ our kernel (new 07-12) | ✓ | ✓ | 1.5–2× faster, all sizes incl. 1024 |

### Single precision, real (f32)

| operation | works? | tested? | benchmarked? | vs scipy |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| multiply, LU, QR, eigenvalues | ✓ same kernels as f64 | ✓ | ✓ | 2–9× faster |
| Schur | ✓ same kernel as f64 | ✓ | ✓ | 1.7–2.5× faster to n=256, 1.1× at 512 |
| eigenvectors (full eig) | ✓ same kernel as f64 | ✓ | ✓ | 2.9–4.4× faster |

### Double precision, complex (c64)

| operation | works? | tested? | benchmarked? | vs scipy |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| multiply, LU, QR, SVD, eigen | ✓ (faer's, unmodified) | ✓ | ✓ | mixed: matmul 4–5×, QR 2–4×, LU ~1× |
| Schur | ✓ our kernel + SIMD rotations | ✓ | ✓ | ~parity: verdicts at single sizes flip with the CI machine (0.9–1.6×) |
| eigenvectors (full eig) | ✓ our kernel (new 07-12) | ✓ | ✓ | 2.1–3.2× faster, all sizes — the widest margins in the project |

### Single precision, complex (c32)

Nothing of ours exists. faer's built-in c32 works but is untested and
unmeasured by us. Building c32 versions of our kernels is a known,
scoped job — queued behind the packaging decision.

## 3. The direction reset (2026-07-18) — read this first

Andy's benchmark experiment overturned a founding assumption: faer's
matrix multiply — the engine every kernel routes its heavy work to —
is actually **slower than a simple streaming loop** on the reference
machines (by 10–30% up to n=512; about even at 1024). That triggered a
re-derivation of the project goals. The decisions, in plain terms:

- **New yardstick**: success is now "how close to the machine's
  physical speed limits are we," not "how much faster than scipy are
  we." scipy stays on the scoreboard for marketing only.
- **New plan**: build our own complete BLAS layer first (the simple
  fast loops, properly named, tested, and benchmarked), then make our
  LAPACK-layer functions use it. Step 1 (done): the FMA build — a
  faster multiply instruction — doubles the machine's speed limit but
  does NOT rescue faer's multiply; it helps some of our loops
  (trmm/trsm/gemv) and actively hurts another (syrk), so each
  operation gets its variant picked by measurement. Step 2 (done):
  Andy asked whether the plan's "hand-SIMD buys nothing here" rows
  were ever tested — they weren't, we raced them, and all three
  assumptions were wrong (swap 1.2–1.3× faster with SIMD, asum
  3.5–4×, iamax 1.4–1.6×, on all three CI machines). The full build
  list with evidence per row is `docs/blas-layer-plan-2026-07.md`.
- **Threading: decided no** — browsers demand a server configuration
  (COOP/COEP) Andy excludes, and the honest payoff is small for our
  matrix sizes anyway. GPU (for f32) and batch parallelism remain
  future options.
- **Long-term**: faer-wasm is heading toward standing on its own.
  faer's remaining functions get replaced one measured campaign at a
  time — never on principle, only on evidence.

## 4. Known gaps and next levers (for the architect to pick from)

- **Schur near parity at larger sizes** — Schur rows with margins under
  ~1.3× flip between win and loss depending on which machine CI hands
  us (complex Schur at 256 read 0.89× on two machines and 1.21× on a
  third; real Schur at 512 read 1.10× and 0.95×). The honest claim is
  "about even". Rows with margins of 1.4× and up — all of LU/QR/
  matmul/eigenvalues/eig — replicate on every machine.
- **real Schur at n=1024** — a tie, not a win; the remaining cost is in
  faer's large-size path, levers documented in the research doc.
- **re-check old numbers** — on 2026-07-11 we found our old benchmark
  setup was unfairly slowing OUR side of every large-size comparison (an
  allocator problem, now fixed). Numbers published before then understate
  us; they're flagged, not yet all re-measured.
- **benchmark honesty (2026-07-12)** — CI hands us a different machine
  each run, and identical code drifted 7–15% between two runs. So a
  number from one run can't be compared with a number from another; only
  comparisons made back-to-back inside a single run count. Our
  scipy-vs-us verdicts already work that way; judging our own code
  changes now does too (`bench/ab-crot.mjs`).

## The consistency rule (adopted 2026-07-11)

Every new kernel gets the full treatment before its campaign closes:
correctness test **and** benchmark row, in **every** number type it
supports — or an explicit "gap" line in this file saying why not.
