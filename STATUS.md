# STATUS — the one-page scoreboard

Plain-English answer to three questions: **what did we change in faer,
what do we ship, and how good is it?** Updated at the end of every
working session. Details and evidence live in `docs/` and the README
evidence grid; this page is the summary you can hold in your head.

Last updated: 2026-07-11.

## 1. What we changed in faer itself

**Four patches, ~19 lines total.** That's everything. They live in
`patches/` and get applied to a pinned copy of faer on every build.

| patch | size | what it does |
| - | - | - |
| 0001 | 4 lines | fixes the compile error that stopped faer building on wasm at all |
| 0002 | 6 lines | makes faer's internal Schur functions public so our code can call them |
| 0003 | 4 lines (to pulp, faer's SIMD library) | fixes a bug that made all complex math wrong in one build mode |
| 0004 | 1 line | fixes a typo'd formula that made eigenvalue solving ~50–85× slower |

Everything else in this repo is **our own code in our own folders**
(`kernels/`, `schur/`, `smoke-test/`, `bench/`). It calls faer; it does
not modify faer.

## 2. What we ship, and how good it is

"vs scipy" = the honest head-to-head on the CI runner, both sides
running in the browser engine. Numbers >1 mean we're faster.

### Double precision, real numbers (f64) — the main product

| operation | works? | tested? | benchmarked? | vs scipy |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| multiply (matmul) | ✓ (faer's, unmodified) | ✓ | ✓ | 3–20× faster |
| solve Ax=b (LU) | ✓ our kernel | ✓ | ✓ | 1.6–2× faster |
| QR | ✓ our kernel | ✓ | ✓ | ~3× faster |
| SVD | ✓ (faer's, unmodified) | ✓ | ✓ | 0.7–1.5× (near its ceiling — proven) |
| eigenvalues | ✓ our kernel | ✓ | ✓ | 1.5–2.1× faster, all sizes |
| Schur (T and Z) | ✓ our kernel | ✓ | ✓ | 1.1–1.7× faster up to n=512; ~tie at 1024 |

### Single precision, real (f32)

| operation | works? | tested? | benchmarked? | vs scipy |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| multiply, LU, QR, eigenvalues | ✓ same kernels as f64 | ✓ | ✓ | 2–9× faster |
| Schur | ✓ same kernel as f64 | ✓ | **✗ — gap** | not measured |

### Double precision, complex (c64)

| operation | works? | tested? | benchmarked? | vs scipy |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| multiply, LU, QR, SVD, eigen | ✓ (faer's, unmodified) | ✓ | ✓ | mixed: matmul 4–5×, QR 2–4×, LU ~1× |
| Schur | ✓ our kernel (new today) | ✓ | ✓ | 1.0–1.4× faster, except 0.9× at n=256 |

### Single precision, complex (c32)

Nothing of ours exists. faer's built-in c32 works but is untested and
unmeasured by us. Building c32 versions of our kernels is a known,
scoped job — queued behind the packaging decision.

## 3. Known gaps and next levers (for the architect to pick from)

- **f32 Schur benchmark row** — the code works and is tested; adding the
  benchmark is ~30 minutes.
- **complex Schur at n=256** — loses 10% because our rotation loop isn't
  SIMD yet; the fix is known and contained.
- **real Schur at n=1024** — a tie, not a win; the remaining cost is in
  faer's large-size path, levers documented in the research doc.
- **re-check old numbers** — today we found our old benchmark setup was
  unfairly slowing OUR side of every large-size comparison (an allocator
  problem, now fixed). Numbers published before today understate us;
  they're flagged, not yet all re-measured.

## The consistency rule (adopted 2026-07-11)

Every new kernel gets the full treatment before its campaign closes:
correctness test **and** benchmark row, in **every** number type it
supports — or an explicit "gap" line in this file saying why not.
